Having taught, protected and advised Jesus throughout his childhood, he is widely believed as the spiritual and corporeal father of Jesus Christ.

As the patron of workers, he’s the role model we should strive to be – hardworking, compassionate, obedient and kind-hearted. Saint Joseph teaches us to become men of silence – to hold our tongues and understand so that we can hear the voice of God.</p>
